# üè• Multi-User Hospital Management System

A **full-stack hospital management web application** built with **Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Node.js**. This platform centralizes healthcare services, providing **patients and hospitals a unified system** to access and manage medical resources efficiently.

## üåç Real-World Problem

In cities like **Mumbai**, there is no **centralized platform** where users can:

- Check available hospital beds, ICUs, or blood units in real time  
- Compare hospitals based on cost, ratings, and services  
- Book appointments without calling multiple hospitals  

This project solves this by **integrating all public and private hospitals under one platform**, making healthcare **affordable, transparent, and efficient**.
