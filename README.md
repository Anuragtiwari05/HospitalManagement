Hospital Management System

A full-stack hospital management web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Node.js. This platform centralizes healthcare services, providing patients and hospitals a unified system to access and manage medical resources efficiently.

üåç Real-World Problem

In cities like Mumbai, there is no centralized platform where users can:

Check available hospital beds, ICUs, or blood units in real time

Compare hospitals based on cost, ratings, and services

Book appointments without calling multiple hospitals

This project solves this by integrating all public and private hospitals under one platform, making healthcare affordable, transparent, and efficient.
